There is a fee for processing the documents. **THE DOCUMENTATION AND CHECK MUST ARRIVAL 10 DAYS PRIOR TO ARRIVAL** to qualify for same-day release and reduced fees.

3. OUTBOUND-SIDE:
	1. CRATE REQUIREMENTS:
		1. Hawaiian Airlines only allows a limited quantity of animals to be transported in the baggage compartment of the aircraft, which are **accommodated on a first-booked basis**.
		2. To reserve space for your animal, we encourage you to provide at least 48-hours advance notification of your intent to travel with your pet by contacting our Reservations Department at 1-800-367-5320.
		3. Hawaiian Airlines requires pets to travel with an animal health certificate.
		4. **Travel in passenger cabin:**
			1. If using a carrier in the passenger cabin (ie for cat): Does not exceed 16” long x 10” wide x 9.5” high. The pet and carrier combined may not exceed 25 lbs total.

			1. Travel between Hawaii and North America: $225.00 USD
			2. Maximum allowable size is 36” long x 25” wide x 28” high.
			3. To qualify, your pet must not be longer, wider or taller than the dimensions of the kennel.

	2. **IF PETS SHOWS AGGRESSION OR IS VISIBLY SEDATED WHEN THEY COME TO THE AIRPORT THEY WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO FLY.**
	3. Recommended to use bowls that attach to the inside of the crate door for food and water.
	4. Many pet parents think sedating their pets will ensure a stress-free pet travel experience. However, veterinary experts agree that sedating a pet before air travel is not recommended. Sedatives are known to reduce heart rate and body temperature in a pet. Every pet responds differently to sedatives, and sometimes sedatives can cause adverse reactions in a pet. Most pet travel experts recommend that you place an old blanket or a t-shirt that smells of you in the crate to reassure your pet during the flight.
	5. The lights in the hold are dimmed, and most pets are calm and sleep during the entire flight. The cargo hold is safer and quieter than the cabin where your pet can be overwhelmed by the people and the noise. 
4. ARRIVAL-SIDE:

	4. WARNING: All pets arriving before the eligible date of entry will be quarantined and assessed $14.30 each day in addition to the $244.00 program fee. There are no exceptions.

Take dogs in their pet kennel to the inspection office at LAX to confirm prior to takeoff they satisfy requirements. If they don't you need to act fast to fix whatever they complain about. I've thoroughly gone over dimensions and weight a lot so this is a non-issue but do this just to be safe
