Practically all modern self-searching starts with "Cogito, ergo sum", i.e. "I think, therefore I am."

I think, I perceive, and I see the world with utmost subjectivity. I find myself, quite naturally, in the centre of my world. My historicity defines the history of my world. This **I** became so valuable I cannot imagine a world without it. Indeed, I **MUST** be, be it in the afterlife, an endless cycle of rebirth, or simply as a tiny flux of consciousness stored in some corner of the universe.

Or, I think, therefore like every thinking things I exist. I share an objective world and history with many other things. This **I** is as much significant as others of its kind. Like them, it can arise from and [dissolve into unconsciousness](../Entities/Concept/Buddhism/Pratītyasamutpāda.md). This [doesn't allow an eternal soul](../Entities/Concept/Buddhism/Anatman.md) but can bestow one with [a full moon over a pine forest with an 'ah!' barely audible](..III.%20Reading/Notes%20and%20Highlights/Narrow%20Road%20to%20the%20Interior%20and%20Other%20Writings.md#^83dc7c), a sunrise that set our whole life ablaze, in short, the [pathos of things](../Entities/Concept/Aesthetics/Mono%20no%20aware.md).
