Lately, I've been familiar with three ideas. One is from the book **[God Delusion](..III.%20Reading/Have%20Read/The%20God%20Delusion%20by%20Richard%20Dawkins)** by *Richard Dawkins*. He argued that maybe religion is a side effect of other evolutionary traits which enables us to *maybe* work as a team. Then *Yuval Noah Harari* introduced me to the **knowledge illusion** in his book **[[21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari\|21 Lessons for the 21st Century]]**, which enable us to believe to know something which we don't know personally but is known to someone somewhere. And in **[Denial of Death](..III.%20Reading/Have%20Read/The%20Denial%20of%20Death%20by%20Ernest%20Becker)** *Ernest Becker* explained that Sigmund Freud did a great work on how people rather blindly follow people in [a book](..III.%20Reading/Have%20Read/Group%20Psychology%20and%20the%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Ego%20by%20Sigmund%20Freud) ~~(I have to read that)~~. It is their urge to follow someone, to feel secure, like in the arms of their parents.

Now, I wonder, are they somehow connected in the depth of our biology?

Upon further inspection, it feels like faith has some obvious biological dependencies. Our larger neocortex allows us to [be more social](..III.%20Reading/Notes%20and%20Highlights/How%20Religion%20Evolved%20by%20Robin%20Dunbar#^e64ec4). It also allows us to [mentalize](..III.%20Reading/Notes%20and%20Highlights/How%20Religion%20Evolved%20by%20Robin%20Dunbar#^652db9) deeply nested ideas:

| Intentionality level | Possible statements of belief | Form of religion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | I believe that [rain is falling]| not possible |
| 2nd | I believe that you think [rain is falling] | not possible |
| 3rd | I believe that you think that God exists [in a transcendental world] | religious fact |
| 4th | I believe that you think that God exists and intends to punish us | personal religion |
| 5th | I believe that you think that we both know that God exists and intends to punish us | communal religion |

From the 3rd level onwards, it allows us to have religious faith. But, faiths by themselves are memes having their courses through generations by non-biological means. Although **knowledge illusion** and **group psychology** explain why someone will believe in a specific dogma in the first place, **the belief that knowledge illusion invokes is different from the faith that religious experience brings in.** Faith is more akin to schizophrenia than communal belief.
