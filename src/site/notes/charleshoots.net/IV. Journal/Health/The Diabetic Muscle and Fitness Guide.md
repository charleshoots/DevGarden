1. There are two primary hormones relevant to diabetes, insulin and glucagon. There endocrine-producing cells of the pancreas are known as pancreatic islet of Langerhans that control the secretion of these two hormones specifically. There are about 3-million of these islet cells in the pancreas of a normal human.
	1. These islet cells for controlling the two major hormones necessary for glucose homeostasis come in 4 types:
		1. Alpha Cells
			1. Secrete Glucagon in response to a decrease in glucose in the blood.
		2. Beta Cells
			1. Secrete insulin in response to an increase in glucose in the blood or being told of an impending increase.
		3. Delta Cells
			1. Secrete somatostatin hormone which stops the secretion of both insulin and glucagon hormones when the production of cells get out of control.
		4. Gamma Cells
			1. Secrete pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increases the feeling of satiety, the increase of gastric emptying of the stomach, and contraction of the bladder.
2. The Liver
	1. Largest solid organ in the body, weighing about 4 pounds in men. Hols approximately 13% of your total blood supply at any given time and has over 500 functions.
		1. Dietary carbohydrates are not essential. However, the body does need glucose every day. The brain typically requires 130g of glucose every day to function properly. Not all glucose has to come from the diet directly though because the liver has the ability to synthesize carbs from scratch. At the other end, if there is too many carbs it can produce fat from the excess.
		2. The liver serves as a warehouse for glucose storage and glucose production. This is where fat is created from glucose. This is also where glucose is made from fat.
		3. When insulin is deficient, glucose cannot enter its respected cell for use as energy. The liver response to the starving cells.
		4. The fact that insulin is injected into the subcutaneous title means there is a relatively low insulin concentration at the intersection between the insulin/glucagon secreting pancreas and the glucose shuttle inputs which are the spleen, stomach, and intestines. This intersection is known as the main portal vein. So, instead of getting insulin immediately at the site it will be used and mixed with the blood supply, which is the liver via the main portal vein, it must first go from the subcutaneous injection site and then circulate throughout the entire body before it ever gets to the liver to reduce glucose levels in the blood.
		5. GLP-1 and Amylin are available as medications.
