No point in mentioning the obvious. Is he a good writer? He is great. Does he have a deep understanding of the clockwork of the human heart? He does. There can't be a great writer without this understanding and wit.

What I liked about this book is (which may be a fault as translators of this series have noted) the stylistic switch Proust did between *lyrical, poetic moving text* and *prosaic, matter-of-fact but strong plot* styles.

The successful usage of **Involuntary Memory**. There is, of course, the classic *'Madeleine Incident'* which invoked a nostalgia for things happend decades ago. But I think the most powerful usage of involuntary memories can be found in the [PART II - Swann in Love](../Notes%20and%20Highlights/Swann_s%20Way%20by%20Marcel%20Proust.md#PART%20II%20-%20Swann%20in%20Love). The *Vinteuil Sonata*[^1] [ invoked love in Swann, helped it to flourish](../Notes%20and%20Highlights/Swann_s%20Way%20by%20Marcel%20Proust.md#^739162), and at the end induced the epiphany that lead to a clearer understanding of his place in his relationship with Odette.

* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.

But since its original prewar translation there has been no completely new version in English. Now, Penguin Classics brings Proust’s masterpiece to new audiences throughout the world, beginning with Lydia Davis’s internationally acclaimed translation of the first volume, Swann’s Way. Swann's Way is one of the preeminent novels of childhood: a sensitive boy's impressions of his family and neighbors, all brought dazzlingly back to life years later by the taste of a madeleine. It also enfolds the short novel "Swann in Love," an incomparable study of sexual jealousy that becomes a crucial part of the vast, unfolding structure of In Search of Lost Time. The first volume of the work that established Proust as one of the finest voices of the modern age—satirical, skeptical, confiding, and endlessly varied in his response to the human condition—Swann's Way also stands on its own as a perfect rendering of a life in art, of the past recreated through memory.
