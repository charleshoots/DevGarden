# Definition
Power is the [[Rate of Change\|rate]] at which [energy](Work) is transferred over time. It's the [[Instantaneous\|instantaneous]] rate at which [work](Work) is being performed on an object. It is a [[Scalar & Vectors\|scalar]] measurement in [[Watt\|watts]]. Mathematically, power can be defined in many ways but most commonly as

$$
P = \frac{dE}{dt}= \frac{\vec{F(t)} \cdot \vec{dr}}{dt} = \vec{F(t)} \cdot \vec{v(t)}
$$
If the force was not constant, to determine the average power over time, integrating over time is needed like below.

$$\begin{array}{c}
P_{avg} = \frac{P(t)}{\Delta t} \\ 
P_{avg} = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_t ^ T P(t)dt \\ 
P_{avg} =  \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_t ^ T  \frac{F(t) \cdot dr}{dt} dt \\ 
P_{avg} =  \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_t ^ T F\cdot dr \\
P_{avg} = \frac{W}{\Delta t}
\end{array}$$
