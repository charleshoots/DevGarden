# Definiton
Kinetic energy is how much energy an object has because it is moving. It's the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Energy & Work/Work\|work]] done on an object to give it or keep it in motion 

## Derivation (Work-Energy Theorem)
> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive an equation to describe the energy when a force gives an object motion, assume the following:
> - [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Energy & Work/Work\|Work]] is general is $W = \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{dx}$
> - The [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Forces\|force]] is always constant
> - Force is described as $F=ma$
> - The object has mass $m$
> - From [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Kinematics\|kinematics]] $ax = \frac{1}{2}(v^2 - v_0
{ #2}
)$

$$\begin{array}{c}  
W = \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{dx}\\
W = F\Delta x \\ 
W = ma\Delta x \\ 
W = \frac{1}{2}m (v^2 - v_0
{ #2}
) \\  \\
\text{So the kinetic energy can be described as:} \\
\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}m (v^2 - v_0
{ #2}
)  \\ \\

\text{Then we make the defintion of a work-energy theorem:} \\

W = \Delta K \\

\end{array}$$

> [!note]
$W =\Delta K$ is valid for any type of energy $W = \Delta E$
