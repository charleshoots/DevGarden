# Definition
The conservation of momentum is a special case when the net [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Impulse\|impulse]] is zero. This implies that no [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Newton Laws\|external forces]] are acting on a body or a system. From the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Impulse-Momentum Theorem\|impulse momentum theorem]], because the net impulse is zero, the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Linear Momentum\|change in momentum]] is zero as well.

\text{If $I=0$} \Rightarrow \Delta p =0
