> [!summary]
Impulse is the change in linear momentum over time.
> 
**Key Equations:**
> 
Impulse in general:
$I = \int_{t_i} ^ {t_f} F (t) dt$
> 
Impulse if force is constant:
$I = F\Delta t$

# Definition 
Impulse is the [[Rate of Change\|change]] in [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Linear Momentum\|linear momentum]] over time.  It describes the change in forces over a time period. Sometimes impulse is denoted as $I$ or $J$

## Derivation
> [!warning]
This definition uses that $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$ from [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Newton Laws\|Newton's second law]] to simplify reasoning and math

$$\begin{array}{c}

F = \frac{dp}{dt}\\
I = \int_{t_i} ^ {t_f} F(t)dt \\ 
\text{If F is consant the equation becomes} \\ 
I = F\Delta t
\end{array}$$
