# Definition 
Center of mass in terms of acceleration describes the [acceleration](../Kinematics/Acceleration) of a point as if all the mass were centred on a point. By definition of [acceleration](../Kinematics/Acceleration) it's the [[Derivative\|derivative]] of the [center of mass velocity](Center%20of%20Mass%20Velocity%20&%20Momentum).

$$
\begin{align*}
a_{cm} &= \frac{dr}{dt} v_{cm} \\
&= \frac{\sum_{i}m_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{i}m_{i}} 
\end{align*}
