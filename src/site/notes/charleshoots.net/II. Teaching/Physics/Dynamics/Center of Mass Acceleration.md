# Definition 
Center of mass in terms of acceleration describes the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Acceleration\|acceleration]] of a point as if all the mass were centred on a point. By definition of [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Acceleration\|acceleration]] it's the [[Derivative\|derivative]] of the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Center of Mass Velocity & Momentum\|center of mass velocity]].

$$
\begin{align*}
a_{cm} &= \frac{dr}{dt} v_{cm} \\
&= \frac{\sum_{i}m_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{i}m_{i}} 
\end{align*}
