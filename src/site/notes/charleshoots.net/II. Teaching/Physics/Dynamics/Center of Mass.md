# Definition 
The center of mass (COM) is a point where the average location of all the mass is. A point where you can imagine "all" the mass being located at. The location of the COM is a [[Scalar & Vectors\|vector]] relative to a reference point, which can be arbitrarily chosen. Mathematically, it is defined below, where $m_{i}$ and $r$ is the [displacement](../Kinematics/Displacement.md) from the reference point and $M$ is the total mass. 

$$
\begin{array}{c} 
 \text{Descrite Masses}\\
\vec{R}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i} m_{i}r_{i} \\
 \\
\text{Continous masses} \\
\vec{R}_{cm} = \frac{1}{M} \int r dm
\end{array}
$$


> [!bug] Common Misconception 
[Moment of Inertia](../Rotational%20Mechanics/Moment%20of%20Inertia.md) describes how mass is disturbed relative to an axis. 
Center of Mass describes a point where you can imagine all the mass to be located at relative to a reference point.
