# Definition 
The center of mass in terms of dynamics describes the [external forces](External%20&%20Internal%20Forces) as if all the mass were centred on a point. This describes the motion of the center of mass using [Newton's laws](Newton%20Laws).

## Derivation 
> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive an equation to describe the external forces on the center of mass, assume the following:
> - The [velocity center of a mass](Center%20of%20Mass%20Velocity%20&%20Momentum) in terms of [momentum](Linear%20Momentum) is $v_{cm} = \frac{p_{tot}}{M}\Rightarrow p_{tot}=v_{cm}M$
> - The [[Derivative\|derivative]] of [velocity](../Kinematics/Velocity) is [acceleration](../Kinematics/Acceleration)
> - The [[Derivative\|derivative]] of [momentum](Linear%20Momentum) is the [external force](Newton%20Laws)

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ p_{tot}= v_{cm}M \right]  \\
\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dt}M \\
F_{ext}=a_{cm}M
\end{array}
$$
