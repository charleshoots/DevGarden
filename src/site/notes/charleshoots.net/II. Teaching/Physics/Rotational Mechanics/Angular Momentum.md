# Definition
Angular momentum is used to describe how much "hard" it is to give an object rotation. It's similar to [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Linear Momentum\|linear momentum]] in that it **can be** a conversed quantity, but is **not an intrinsic property, nor is it always conserved.** It depends on your reference frame and is only conserved if the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Torque\|net torque]] is zero. 

>[!warning] Angular momentum does not **ALWAYS** mean spinning in a circle
Most situations of angular momentum involve an object spinning in a circle. You can also have angular momentum if an object has [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Linear Momentum\|linear momentum]] and has a sideways component (not moving straight)

Mathematically, angular momentum is the cross product between [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Dynamics/Linear Momentum\|linear momentum]] and the r displacement [[Scalar & Vectors\|vector]]. The r [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Displacement\|displacement]] vector is the reference point, which can be arbitrarily chosen. Meaning certain reference frames will not have angular momentum.

$$\vec{L}  = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$$

# Special Case For Rotating Rigid Bodies
>[!warning] Assumption
For this special case, assume the following:
> -  The object is rotating symmetrically. 
> - The origin at in the middle of the rotating object
> - The rotation can be described from [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Rotational Kinematics\|rotational kinematics]] $v = \omega \times r$

$$\begin{array}{c}
L = r \times p \\ 
L = r \times (mv) \\ 
L = mr \times (\omega \times r)  \\ 
L = mr^2 \omega \\ 
L = I\omega \\ 
\end{array}$$
