# Definition 
Uniform circular motion is an object rotating at with constant [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Speed\|linear speed.]] An object in uniform circular motion will also have constant [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Angular Speed\|angular speed]]. The rotation around a circle is caused by the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Centripetal Force\|centripetal force]] and [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Centripetal Acceleration\|centripetal acceleration]], which are always perpendicular to [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Kinematics/Velocity\|linear velocity vector]].

> [!note] Explanation
Example of uniform circular acceleration.
Linear velocity is perpendicular to the centripetal force
