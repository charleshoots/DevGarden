# Definition 
Uniform circular motion is an object rotating at with constant [linear speed.](../Kinematics/Speed.md) An object in uniform circular motion will also have constant [angular speed](Angular%20Speed.md). The rotation around a circle is caused by the [centripetal force](Centripetal%20Force.md) and [centripetal acceleration](Centripetal%20Acceleration.md), which are always perpendicular to [linear velocity vector](../Kinematics/Velocity.md).

Example of uniform circular acceleration.
Linear velocity is perpendicular to the centripetal force
