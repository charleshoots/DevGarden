# Definition 
Uniform circular motion is an object rotating at with constant [linear speed.](../Kinematics/Speed) An object in uniform circular motion will also have constant [angular speed](Angular%20Speed). The rotation around a circle is caused by the [centripetal force](Centripetal%20Force) and [centripetal acceleration](Centripetal%20Acceleration), which are always perpendicular to [linear velocity vector](../Kinematics/Velocity).

Example of uniform circular acceleration.
Linear velocity is perpendicular to the centripetal force
