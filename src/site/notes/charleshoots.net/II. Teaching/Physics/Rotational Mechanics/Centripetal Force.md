# Definition 
The centripetal force is not a new force and describes how objects rotate in a circle. The centripetal force is a center-seeking force that forces the object to rotate in a circle. This force is only valid in [inertial frame of references](../Dynamics/Frames%20of%20Reference). Mathematically, this is described using [centripetal acceleration](Centripetal%20Acceleration) and [Newton's second law](../Dynamics/Newton%20Laws)

F_{c} = ma_{c} = \frac{mv^2}{r}
