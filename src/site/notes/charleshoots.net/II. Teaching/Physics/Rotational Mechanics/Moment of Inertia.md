# Moment of Inertia 
Moment of inertia (MOI) sometimes called rotational inertia, describes how a body mass is disturbed relative to an axis. The reference axis is completely arbitrary in that it can be defined. The mathematical definition is derived to simplify [rotational kinetic energy](Rotational%20Kinetic%20Energy%20&%20Work-Energy%20Theorem), defined below.

$$
\begin{array}{c} \\
\text{Descrite Masses} \\
I_{0}= \displaystyle \sum_{i} m_{i}{r_{i}^2}  \\
 \\  \text{Continous Masses}
 \\
I_{0} = \displaystyle\int r^2 dm
\end{array}
$$

Example of rotational inertia for a hollow cylinder. The reference axis is chosen for $r$ to be equal distance to the closest $m_{i}$ around the circle

> [!bug] Common Misconception 
Moment of inertia describes how mass is disturbed relative to an axis. 
[Center of Mass](../Dynamics/Center%20of%20Mass) describes a point where you can imagine all the mass to be located at.

If we assume we dont know where the point of rotation is and are solving for the CM, well assume the 2m mass to be the zero point. So we get the CM as:
>$$x_{cm} = \frac{\sum m_i x_i}{\sum m_i} = \frac{2m(0) + mL}{2m+m} = \frac{1}{3}L$$

Now we can find the inertia CM.
>$$I = \sum m_i r_i
{ #2}
 = (2m)(\frac{1}{3}L)^2 + m(\frac{2}{3}L)^2 = \frac{2}{3}mL^2$$
