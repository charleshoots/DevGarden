# Rotating Work
Rotational work measures the [energy](../Energy%20&%20Work/Energy.md) transferred when a force moves an object rotationally. An object will only rotate when a [torque](Torque.md) is applied to it. So mathematically, rotational work is the integral of [torque](Torque.md) [[Dots Product & Angles\|dotted]] with [angular displacement](Angular%20Displacement.md). 

$$
W= \int_{a}^b \tau \cdot d\theta 
$$

> [!note]
There is a [[Dots Product & Angles\|dot product]] between [torque](Torque.md) and [angular displacement](Angular%20Displacement.md) because only the [[Tangential & Perpendicular\|perpendicular]] force contributes to rotational motion.
