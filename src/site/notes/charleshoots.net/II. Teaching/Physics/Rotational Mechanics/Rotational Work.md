# Rotating Work
Rotational work measures the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Energy & Work/Energy\|energy]] transferred when a force moves an object rotationally. An object will only rotate when a [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Torque\|torque]] is applied to it. So mathematically, rotational work is the integral of [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Torque\|torque]] [[Dots Product & Angles\|dotted]] with [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Angular Displacement\|angular displacement]]. 

$$
W= \int_{a}^b \tau \cdot d\theta 
$$

> [!note]
There is a [[Dots Product & Angles\|dot product]] between [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Torque\|torque]] and [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Physics/Rotational Mechanics/Angular Displacement\|angular displacement]] because only the [[Tangential & Perpendicular\|perpendicular]] force contributes to rotational motion.
