# Definition 
Angular acceleration describes the rotational acceleration an object has. It is a [[Scalar & Vectors\|vector]] quantity. Mathematically, it is the [[Derivative\|derivative]] of [angular velocity](Angular%20Velocity.md).

$$
\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dt}
$$

> [!note] Tangential component 
Since angular acceleration is acceleration on a curve, it can have an [[Tangential & Perpendicular\|tangential]] component to its direction. Given as the angular acceleration a distance away.
> 
$\alpha_{t}=r\alpha$
