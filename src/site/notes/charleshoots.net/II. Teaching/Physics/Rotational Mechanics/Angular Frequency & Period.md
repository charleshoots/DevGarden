The period is the time to complete one rotation.
Frequency is the rotations per second

Period:
$T = \text{Time for one cycle}$

Frequency:
$f =\frac{\text{Cycles}}{\text{second}}$
> 
Reciprocal:
$T = \frac{1}{f}$
$f=\frac{1}{T}$

# Definition 
Angular frequency and period both describe how fast an object is rotating around a circle. Period ($T$) is the time to take to complete 1 full rotation (one oscillation or revolution). It is measured in seconds. Frequency ($f$) is the number of cycles per second, measured in Hz.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Period} &= \text{Time for one cycle} \\ 
&= \frac{1}{f} \\ \\ 
\text{Frequency} &=  \frac{\text{Cycles}}{\text{Second}} \\ 
&= \frac{1}{T}
\end{align*}
