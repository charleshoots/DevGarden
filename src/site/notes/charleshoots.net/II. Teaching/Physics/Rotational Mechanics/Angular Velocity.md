> [!summary]
Angular velocity states how fast an object is rotating in a direction
> 
**Key Equations:**
> 
Angular velocity:
$\vec{\omega} = \frac{d\theta}{dt} =\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t\cdot r} = \frac{v}{r}$
> 
Tangential angular velocity:
$\vec{\omega_{t}}=\omega r$

# Definition 
Angular velocity is a [[Scalar & Vectors\|vector quantity]] that tells you how fast an object is rotating around a circle and the direction it is rotating. Mathematically, it is the [[Instantaneous\|instantaneous change]] of [angular displacement](Angular%20Displacement)

$$
\vec{\omega} = \frac{d\theta}{dt} =\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t\cdot r} = \frac{v}{r}
$$

> [!note] Tangential component
Since angular velocity a vector on a curve, it will have two components. One being its [[Tangential & Perpendicular\|tangential component]] defined as the angular velocity a distance away from rotation.
> 
$\vec{\omega_{t}}=\omega r$
