Let $G$ be a group. If $S$ is a subset o f$G$ such that the subgroup $\langle S \rangle$ generated by $G$ is all of $G$, then $S$ is said to *generate* $G$, and the elements of $S$ are called *generators for $G$*. 

Given any object $\sigma$, we can form an infinite cyclic group generated by $\sigma$, called the *free group generated by $\sigma$* and denoted by $F(\sigma)$, as follows: $F(\sigma)$ is the set $\{\sigma\} \times \Bbb Z$ with the operation being $(\sigma, m)(\sigma, n) := (\sigma, k+m)$. We identify $\sigma$ with the element $(\sigma, 1)$, and we use the notation $\sigma^n$ for elements of $F(\sigma)$.

We degine the *free group on $S$*  denoted by $F(S)$, to be the free product of all infinite cyclic groups generated by elements of $S$: $$F(S) := \coprod_{\sigma \in S} F(\sigma).$$There is a natural injection $\iota: S \hookrightarrow F(S)$, defined by sending each $\sigma\in S$ to the word $\sigma \in F(S)$. In the case $S = \{\sigma_1,\dots, \sigma_n\}$ is a finte set, we often denote $F(S)$ as $F(\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n)$. 

**Characteristic Property of the Free Group:** Let $S$ be a set. For any group $\varphi: S \to H$, there exists a unique homomorphism $\Phi: F(S) \to H$ extending $\varphi$

F(S) \arrow[dr, dashed, "\Phi"] & \\

\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
```

**Cor:** the Free group on $S$ is the unique group (up to isomorphism) satisfying the characteristic property

Any group $G$ is said to be a *free group* if there is some subset $S\subseteq G$ such that the homomorphism $F(S) \to G$ induced by the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow G$ is an isomorphism.

**Prop:** A group $G$ is free iff it has a generating set $S\subseteq G$ such that every element $g\in G$ other than the identity has a unique expression asa product of the form $$g = \sigma_1^{n_1}\dots, \sigma_k^{n_k},$$ where $\sigma_i \in S$, $n_i \in \Bbb N$, and $\sigma_i \neq \sigma_{i+1}$ for each $i = 1, \dots, k-1$.
