### Morera’s Theorem
Let $f$ be a continuous function on a region $A$, and suppose that $\oint_\gamma f =0$ for every closed curve in $A$. Then $f$ is holomorphic on $A$, and $f = F'$ for some holomorphic function $F$ on $A$.

**********Cor:********** Let $f$ be a continuous function on $A$ and holomorphic on $A\setminus \{ z_0\}$ for some point $z_0 \in A$. Then $f$ is holomorphic on $A$.

### Logarithms of Functions
Let $f$ be an holomorphic function that is never $0$ on a simply connected domain $A$. Then there is a function $g$ holomorphic on $A$ and unique up to addition of constant multiples of $2\pi i$ such that $\exp(g(z)) =f(z)$ for all $z \in A$.
