Assume that two expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ generate the languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively. *Concatenation*, is then defined as $e_1 e_2 := \{xy \mid x \in L_1, y\in L_2\}$. *Alternation*, which is denoted as $|$ is the union of the two languages, $e_1 | e_2 := \{x \in L_1 \lor x \in L_2\}$. *Closure*, which is represented by braces $\{\ \}$, denotes the repetition of the expression $n$ times for $n <\omega$, $\{e_1\} := \{x \in L_1^*\}$. 

**Def:** Regular expressions are those expression that can be constructed from the following rules:
- $\phi$ is regular expression denoting the $\varnothing$.
- $\varepsilon$ is regular expression denoting the language consisting of only the empty string, $\{\varepsilon\}$.
- $a$, where $a\in V_T$, is a regular expression denoting the language of the single symbol $a$, that is, $\{a\}$.
- If $e_1$ and $e_2$ are regular expressions denoting the languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively, then:
	- $(e_1) | (e_2)$ is a regular expression denoting $L_1 \cup L_2$.
	- $(e_1)(e_2)$ is a regular expression denoting $L_1L_2$.
	- $\{e_1\}$ is a regular expression denoting $L_1^*$.

**Def:** Two regular expression are *equal* $(=)$ or *equivalent*if they denote the same language. 

# Finite-State Automatons

**Def:** A *deterministic finite-state automaton* is a $5$-tuple $(K, V_T, M, S, Z)$ where:
- $K$ is a finite nonempty set of elements called states
- $V_T$ is an alphabet called the *input alphabet*.
- $M$ is a mapping from $K\times V_T$ to $K$.
- $S\in K$ is called the *initial state* of *starting state*.
- $Z \subseteq K$ is a nonempty set of *final states*.
The mapping $M$ must follow the following conditions:
- $M(Q, \varepsilon) = Q$ for every $Q \in K$.
- $M(Q, Tt) = M(M(Q, T), t)$ fro all $T \in V_T$ and $t\in V_T^*$.

A sentence $t$ is said to be *accepted* by a DFA if $M(S, t) = P$ for some DFA $F = (K, V_T, M, S, Z)$ such that $t\in V_T^*$ and $P \in Z$. Thus we define $$L(F) := \{t \mid M(S, t) \in Z \land t\in V_T^*\}.$$
### Nondeterministic Finite-State Automatons

**Def:** A *nondeterministic finite-state automaton* is $5$-tuple $(K, V_T, M, S, Z)$ where:
- $K$ is a finite nonempty set of elements called states
- $V_T$ is an alphabet called the *input alphabet*.
- $M$ is a mapping from $K\times V_T$ to $2^K$.
- $S\in K$ is called the *initial state* of *starting state*.
- $Z \subseteq K$ is a nonempty set of *final states*.
The mapping $M$ now must satisfy the following:$$
\begin{align*}
M(Q, \varepsilon) = \{Q\} \qquad \qquad \qquad &\text{where $Q \in K$}\\
M(Q, Tt) = \bigcup_{P \in M(Q, T)} M(P, t) \qquad &\text{where $T\in V_T$ and $t\in V_T^*$} \\
M(\{Q_1, \dots Q_n\}, x) = \bigcup_{i = 1}^n M(Q_i, x) \qquad & \text{where $x \in V_T^*$}
\end{align*}$$We also extend the definition of a NFA to accept an string $x\in V_T^*$ so that $M(S, x) \cap Z \neq \varnothing$.

**Th:** Let $F = (K, V_T, M. S, Z)$ be a nondeterministic finite-state automaton accepting a set of strings $L$. Define a DFA $F'= (K', V_T, M', S', Z')$ as follows:
- The alphabet of states consiste of all the subsets of $K$. An element of $K'$ is denoted as $[S_1, \dots, S_i]$ where $S_1, \dots S_i$ are states fo $K$. The states $S_1, \dots, S_i$ are in the same canonical order so that form some states in $K$, $\{S_1, S_2\} = \{S_2, S_1\}$ is always $[S_1, S_2]$.
- The set of input characters $V_T$ is the same for $F$ and $F'$. 
- The mapping $M'$ is defined as $$M'([S_1, \dots, S_i], T) = [R_1, \dots R_j]$$where $$M(\{S_1, \dots, S_i\}, T) = \{R_1, \dots R_j\}.$$
- If the starting state of $S$, then $S' = [S]$.
- $Z'$ us the set of all states in $K'$ containing a final stat in $Z$.
Then the set of string accepted by $F'$ is the same as for $F$.

**Def:** A *nondeterministic finite-state automaton with $\varepsilon$-transitions* is a $5$-tuple $(K, V_T, M. S, Z)$, where $K$, $V_T$, $S$ and $Z$ are the same as for a NFA and $M$ is a mapping $K \times (V_T \cup \{\varepsilon\})$ into $2^K$.

**Def:** $\varepsilon$-Closure is a set of states of a NFA with $\varepsilon$-transitions, say $F$ such that $\varepsilon$-closure for some state of $F$, call it $q$, includes all attainable states from the state by making state transition with $\varepsilon$-transitions. This is denoted by $\varepsilon-\text{Closure}(q)$.

**Th:** Define $F = (K, V_T, M. S, Z)$ as a NFA with $\varepsilon$-transitions. Then there exists an NFA $F'$ without $\varepsilon$-transitions such that $L(F) = L(F')$.

**Th:** There exists a nondeterministic finite-state auntomaton $F = (K, V_T, M. S, Z)$ which accepts the language generated by the regular grammar $G = (V_N, V_T, S, \Phi)$. 

**Th:** There exists a regular grammar $G = (V_N, V_T, S, \Phi)$ which produces the language accepted by a given deterministic finite-state automaton $F = (K, V_T, M. S, Z)$.
