**Def:** A toplogical space is said to be *compactly generated* if it has the following property: if $A$ is any subset of $X$ whose intersection with each compact subset $K\subseteq X$ is closed in $K$, then $A$ is closed in $X$. 

**Lemma:** First countable spaces and [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Local Compactness\|locally compact]] spaces are compactly generated.
