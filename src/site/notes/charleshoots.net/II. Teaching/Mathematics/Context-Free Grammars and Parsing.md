**Def:** Let $G=(V_N, V_T, S, \Phi)$ be a grammar, and let $\sigma = \phi_1\beta\phi_2$ be a sentential form. Then $\beta$ is called a *phrase* of the sentential form $\sigma$ for some nonterminal $A$ if $$S\stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow} \phi_1 A \phi_2 \qquad \text{and}\qquad A \stackrel{+}{\Rightarrow}\beta.$$Furthermore, $\beta$ is called a *simple phrase* if $S \stackrel{*}{\Rightarrow}\phi_1A\phi_2$ and $A \Rightarrow \beta$.

**Def:** The *handle* of the sentential form is the leftmost simple phrase.

**Def:** A sentence generated by a grammar is *ambiguous* if there exisrt more than one syntax tree for it. A grammar is ambiguous if it generates at least one ambiguous sentence; otherwise it is *unambiguous*. There are certain languages, however, for which no ambiguous grammars can be found. Such languages are said to be *inherentle ambiguous*.

In addition to the relation $\Rightarrow$, which was defined in the connection with a grammar, we can also define the following *leftmost canonical* direct derivation: $$\phi_1 A \phi_2 \underset{L}{\Rightarrow} \phi_1 \beta \phi_2$$if $A\to \beta$ is a rule of the grammar and $\phi_1 \in V_T^*$
