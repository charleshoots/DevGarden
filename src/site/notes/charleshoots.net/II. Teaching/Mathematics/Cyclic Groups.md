**Def:** We define the powers $x^n$ of $x$ (for $n\in \Bbb Z$) as follows:
- $x^0 = e$
- $x^{n+1} = x^n x$ for $n \in \Bbb Z$
- $x^{n-1} = x^n x^{-1}$

**Prop:** Let $G$ be a group and let $x\in G$. Let $m ,n \in \Bbb Z$. Then:
- $x^m x^n = x^{m+n}$
- $(x^n)^{-1} = x^{-n}$
- $(x^m)^n= x^{mn}$

**Def:** For $G$ a group and $x\in G$ define the *order* of $x$ to be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $x^n = 1$, and denote this integer by $o(x)$. In the case $x$ is said to be of order $n$. If no positive power of $x$ is the identity, the order of $x$ is defined to te $o(x) = \infty$, or infinite order.

**Def:** For $x\in G$, then we consider the *subgroup generated by $x$* $\langle x\rangle := \{x^n \in G\mid n \in \Bbb Z\}$. A group $G$ is called *cyclic* if there is an element $x\in G$ such that $G= \langle x\rangle$; then $x$ is then called a *generator* for $G$.

**Th:** If $G$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian

**Prop:** If $G$ is cyclic, then every subgroup of $G$ is cyclic

**Prop:** Let $G$ be a group and $x\in G$.
- $o(x) = o(x^{-1})$
- if $o(x) = n$ and $x^m = e$, then $n \mid m$
- if $o(x) = n$ and $(m, n) = d$, then $o(x^m) = n/d$
- Let $y\in G$, then $o(xy) \mid o(x)o(y)$

**Cor:** If $G = \langle x\rangle$, then $G = \langle x^{-1}\rangle$. 

**Th:** Let $G = \langle x\rangle$. If $o(x) = \infty$, then $x^j \ne x^k$, for $j \ne k$, and as a consequence $G$ is infinite. If $o(x) = n$, then $j \equiv k \pmod n$, and as a consequence the distinct elements of $G$ are $e, x, x^2, \dots, x^{n-1}$. 

**Def:** The *order* of a group $G$, defined by $|G|$ is the cardinality of the set

**Cor:** If $G=\langle x\rangle$, then $|G| = o(x)$.

**Th:** If $G$ is an infinite subgroup generated by $g$, then every power of $g$ is distinct. 

**Th:** If $G$ is a finite group of order $n$, the following statements are equivalent:
{ #f4cacf}

- $G$ is cyclic
- For every divisor $d$ of $n$, $G$ has at most one subgroup of order $d$

**Th:** If $G$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb Z_n$. If $G$ is a cyclic and of infinite order, then $G$ is isomorphic to $\Bbb Z$. 

**Def:** Since the cyclic groups are unique up to isomorphism, we can just denoted $C(n)$ or $C_n$ as the cyclic of order $n$.

**Th:** Every subgroup of $\Bbb Z$ are of the form $n\Bbb Z$ for $n \in \Bbb Z$.
