The Dedekind Psi function is closely related to the Euler phi function by the formula

$$ \psi(n) = \frac{J_2(n)}{J_1(n)} = \frac{J_2(n)}{\phi(n)} $$

and we can write it as

$$ \psi = \operatorname{Id} * |\mu| $$

and it can be written as a product

$$ \psi (n) = n \prod_{p \mid n} \left(1+\frac{1}{p} \right) $$

There are higher order via ratios of the Jordan totient function

$$ \psi_k (n) = \frac{J_{2k}(n)}{J_k(n)} $$

and can be written as a convolution

$$ \psi_k = \operatorname{Id}_k * |\mu| $$
