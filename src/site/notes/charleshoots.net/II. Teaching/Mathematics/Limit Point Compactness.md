**Def:** A space $X$ is said to be *limit point compact* or *weakly countably compact* if every infinite subset of $X$ has a limit point.

**Prop:** Countable compactness implies limit point compactness.

**Cor:** Compactness implies limit point compactness.

**Lemma:** For first countable Hausdorff spaces, limit point compactness implies [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Sequential Compactness\|Sequential Compactness]]

**Th:** For metric spaces and second countable Hausdorff spaces, limit point compactness, sequential compactness, and compactness are all equivalent.
