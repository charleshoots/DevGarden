If $K$ is a field, let $L$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $x^n -1\in K[x]$. If $K = \Bbb Q$, the polynomial is separable, but if $K$ has characteristic $p> 0$, and $n = p^r q$ with $p\not\mid q$, then $$x^n-1 = (x^q-1)^{p^r}\in K[x], $$and the splitting field of $x^q-1$ is the same as the splitting field of $x^n-1$. With this in mind, we can focus on the splitting fields of $x^n -1$ with $p\not\mid n$. Let suppose that the characteristic of $K$ doesn't divide $n$ and $L$ be the splitting field of $x^n-1$. The $n$th roots of unity form a finite group, $\mu_n \le  L^*$, this must be a cyclic group of order $n$. A generator of $\mu_n$ is called a *primitive $n$th root of unity.* If $\omega$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity, then $L = K(\omega)$. We call the fields $L = K(\omega)$ is called a *cyclotomic field*. 

We see that every primitive $n$th root of unity can be used to generate $L$, if we consiser the all of the primitive roots of unity, the polynomial that they define is $$\Phi_n(x) :=\prod_{\omega}(x-\omega)\in L[x],$$where the product is over all the primitive $n$th roots of unity, and this polynomial is known as the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial. 

**Prop:** Let $K$ be a field and suppose that the characteristic of $K$ doesn't divide $n$. If $K_0$ is its prime field of $K$, then $\Phi_n(x)\in K_0[x]$. 

**Th:** Let $K$ be a field and suppose that the characteristic of $K$ doesn't divide $n$. Let $\Phi_n$ the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial over $K$, and let $L$ be the splitting field of $\Phi_n$ over $K$, then
- The extensions $L/K$ is finite and Galois, and $L = K(\omega)$, where $\omega$ is an primitive $n$th root of unity.
- The group $\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is abelian, and is isomorphic to a subgroup of $(\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$.
- The polynomial $\Phi_n$ is irreducible over $K$ iff $\text{Gal}(L/K) \cong (\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$. 

**Prop:** Let $p$ be a prime and $n$ be a positive integer such that $p\not\mid n$. 
- If $\omega$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity, then $[\Bbb F_p(\omega) : \Bbb F_p] = e$, where $e$ is the order of $p$ in $(\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$. 
- $\Phi_n$ is irreducible over $\Bbb F_p$ iff $(\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$ is a cyclic group with $p$ as a generator.

The proposition above tells us that the there must be a primitive root modulo $n$, so must be of the form $q^k$, $2q^k$, $2$ and $4$. 
# Cyclotmic Extensions over $\Bbb Q$

**Def:** Let $\mu_n$ denote the *group of $n$th roots of unity* over $\Bbb Q$. 

**Def:** A generator of the cyclic group $\mu_n$ is called a *primitive $n$th roots of unity*. Let $\zeta_n$ be the a primitive $n$th root of unity. 

**Obs:** Suppose $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Then $\zeta_m \zeta_n$ is a primitive $mn$th root of unity. If $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$th root of unity, and $d$ is divisor of $n$, then $\zeta_n^d$ is a primitive $(n/d)$th root of unity. 

**Def:** We define the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n(x)$ to be the polynomial whose roots are the primitive $n$th roots of unity $$\Phi_n(x) := \prod_{\zeta \text{ primitive }\in \mu_n}(x-\zeta) = \prod_{\substack{1 \le a <n \\ (a, n) = 1}} (x-\zeta_n^a),$$which has degree $\varphi(n)$, where $\varphi(n)$ is the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Euler Totient Function\|Euler Totient Function]]. 

**Obs:** Let $n$ be a positive integer, then $$x^n-1 = \prod_{d \mid n}\Phi_d(x).$$This is equivalent to $$n = \sum_{d\mid n}\phi(d) $$
**Lemma:** The cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n(x)$ is a monic polynomial in $\Bbb Z[x]$ of degree $\varphi(n)$. 

**Prop:** The cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_n$ is an irreducible monic polynomial in $\Bbb Z[x]$ of degree $\varphi(n)$. 

**Prop:** If $n$ is an odd integer, then $\Phi_{2n}(x) = \Phi_n(-x)$. 

**Def:** The field $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)/\Bbb Q$ is called the *cyclotomic field of $n$th roots of unity.* 

**Cor:** The degree over $\Bbb Q$ of the cyclotomic field of $n$th roots of unity is $\varphi(n)$: $$[\Bbb Q(\zeta_n) : \Bbb Q] = \varphi(n). $$
**Prop:** If $K/\Bbb Q$ is a finite field extension, then $K$ has only a finite number of roots of unity. 

**Prop:** We can use the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Möbius Function and Inversion Formula#Möbius Inversion formula\|Möbius inversion formula]] to get the following formula: $$\Phi_n (x):= \prod_{d \mid n }(x^d-1)^{\mu(n/d)}.$$
**Prop:** Let $\ell$ be a prime, and let $\Phi_\ell (x) = (x^\ell-1)/(x-1)\in \Bbb Z[x]$. We want to determine the factorisation of $\Phi_\ell(x)$ modulo $p$ for any prime $p$. Let $\zeta$ denote any fixed primive $\ell$th root of unity.
- If $p = \ell$, then $\Phi_\ell(x) = (x-1)^{\ell-1}\in (\Bbb Z/\ell \Bbb Z)[x]$.
- Suppose $p \neq \ell$, and let $f$ denote the order of $p \mod \ell$. The smallest power of $p$ with $p^f \equiv 1 \pmod \ell$. We know that $\mathbb F_{p^n}$ is cyclic, then $n = f$ is the smallest power $p^n$ of $p$ with $\zeta \in \Bbb F_{p^n}$. This means that the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ over $(\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)[x]$ has degree $f$. 
- We see that $(\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)(\zeta) = (\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)(\zeta^a)$ for any $a$ that is not divisible by $\ell$. Finally, we see that $\Phi_\ell(x)$ is the product of $(\ell-1)/f$ distinct irreducible polynomials of degree $f$in $(\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)[x]$. 

We can get a weakened version of [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Prime Numbers#Dirichlet’s Theorem\|Dirichlet's Theorem on Primes in Arithmetic Progressions]], but without the machinery that are [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Dirichlet L-functions\|Dirichlet L-functions]]. 

**Lemma:** Given any monic polynomial $p(x)\in \Bbb Z[x]$ of degree at least one there are infinitely many distinct prime divisors of the integers $$\{p(n) \mid n \in \Bbb N^+\}.$$

**Lemma:** Let $p$ be a prime and $m$ an integer such that $p \not\mid m$. If $a$ is an integer such that $\Phi_m(a) \equiv 0 \pmod p$, then $(a, p) = 1$, and the order of $a$ in $(\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)^\times$ is $m$. 

**Cor:** Let $a\in \Bbb Z$. If $p$ is an odd prime that divides $\Phi_m(a)$, then either $p$ divides $m$ or $p \equiv 1 \pmod m$. 

**Th:** For any positive integer $m$ there are infinitely many primes $p$ with $p \equiv 1 \pmod m$. 

**Th:** The Galois group of the cyclotomic field $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)$ of $n$th roots of unity is isomorphic to the multiplicative group $(\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$. The isomorphism is given explicitly by the map $a \pmod n \mapsto \sigma_a$, where $\sigma_a(\zeta_n) = \zeta_n^a$. 

**Obs:** A basis for $\Bbb Q(\zeta_p)$ over $\Bbb Q$ is given by $$\zeta_p, \zeta_p^2, \dots, \zeta_p^{p-2},\zeta_p^{p-1}.$$The reason for choosing this basis is that any $\sigma$ in the Galois group $\text{Gal}(\Bbb Q(\zeta_p)/\Bbb Q)$ simply *permutes* these basis elements since these are precisely the primitive $p$ roots of unity.  This where we need that $p$ is prime. Let $H$ be any subgroup of the Galois group of $\Bbb Q(\zeta_p)$ over $\Bbb Q$ and let $$\alpha_H = \sum_{\sigma\in H} \sigma(\zeta_p), $$the sum of the conjugates by the elements in $H$. We can prove that the fixed field of $H$ is $\Bbb Q(\alpha)$. 

**Cor:** Let $n =\prod_{k = 0}^\infty p_k^{\alpha_k}$ be the prime decomposition of the positive integer $n$ into distinct prime powers. Then the cyclotomic fields $\Bbb Q(\zeta_{p_k^{\alpha_k}})$, $k \in \Bbb N$ intersect only in the field $\Bbb Q$ and their composite is the cyclotomic field $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)$. We have $$\text{Gal}(\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)/\Bbb Q) \cong \prod_{k = 0}^\infty \text{Gal}(\Bbb Q(\zeta_{p_k^{\alpha_k}})/\Bbb Q) $$which by the we get the following isomorphism, equivalent to the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Linear Congruences#Chinese Remainder Theorem\|Chinese Remainder Theorem]]$$(\Bbb Z/n \Bbb Z)^\times \cong \prod_{k = 0}^\infty (\Bbb Z/p_k^{\alpha_k}\Bbb Z)^\times  $$
**Th:** Let $G$ be any finite abelian group. Then there is a subfield $K$ of a cyclotomic field with $\text{Gal}(K/\Bbb Q) \cong G$. 

$(*)$ **Kronecker-Weber Theorem:** Let $K$ be a finite abelian extension of $\Bbb Q$. Then $K$ is contained in a cyclotomic extension of $\Bbb Q$. 

**Prop:** Let $\zeta_n$ denote the primitive $n$th root of unity and let $K = \Bbb Q(\zeta_n)$ be the associated cyclotomic field. We see that $\text{Tr}_{K/\Bbb Q} (\zeta_n) = \mu(n),$ where $\mu$ is the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Möbius Function and Inversion Formula\|Möbius function]], and $\text{Tr}_{K/\Bbb Q}$ is the [[charleshoots.net/II. Teaching/Mathematics/Linear Algebraic Invariants in Field Theory\|trace of an element]].

**Prop:** The primitive $n$th roots of unity form a basis over $\Bbb Q$ for the cyclotomic field of $n$th roots of unity iff $n$ is squarefree. 

**Def:** We see that complex conjugation restricts to the automorphism $\sigma_{-1}\in \text{Gal}(\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)/\Bbb Q)$ of the cyclotomic field of $n$th roots of unity. We see that $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n + \zeta_n^{-1})$ is a subfield of the real elements of $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)$. We call this field the *maximal real subfield of $\Bbb Q(\zeta_n)$.*
