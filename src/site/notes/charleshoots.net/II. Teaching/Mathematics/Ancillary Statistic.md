**Def:** A statistic $T(\underline X)$ is which distribution doesn't depend on the parameter $\theta$, it is called an *ancillary statistic.* 

Some ancillary statistics, are
- the range of sample
- sample variance
### Basu Theorem
If $S(\underline X)$ is a sufficient and complete statistic, and $T(\underline X)$ is an ancillary statistic, then $S(\underline X)$ and $T(\underline X)$ are independent.
