Receiver Function

Sunday, January 05, 2014

6:00 PM

receiver function: a time series calculated from teleseismic P wavetrains that can be interpreted in terms of reflections and transmissions of mode-converted waves at discrete boundaries beneath the recording station. They can be used to approximate the crustal structure in the region around the recording station.
