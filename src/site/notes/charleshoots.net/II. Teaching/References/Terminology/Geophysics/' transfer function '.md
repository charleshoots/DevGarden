predescribed rules that distort a seismogram in terms of the series of filters that make up the signal. For example, every recording instrument has a known transfer function that can be removed by mathematical means. The Earth also has its own transfer function. Can also be explained as the Laplace transform of the output signal divided by the Laplace transform of the input symbol.
