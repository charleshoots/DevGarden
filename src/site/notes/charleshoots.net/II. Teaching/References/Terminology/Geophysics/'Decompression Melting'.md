Decompression Melting

Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock#cite_note-Wilson-5) The [solidus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(chemistry)) temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the [Earth's mantle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle) may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the [convection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_convection) of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an [adiabatic process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process), but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate [peridotite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite) samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
