Resolution Matrix (resolving kernel)

Sunday, January 05, 2014

6:00 PM

resolution matrix (resolving kernel): indicate how well the value in the corresponding layer could be determined independently of that of the other layers, if the data had no errors. They illustrate vertical smearing: they are largest at the depth for which they are computed, but have nonzero amplitudes at other depths. The best resolution occurs when the kernel is sharply peaked at the desired depth.
