Rayleigh waves: seismic surface waves with ground motion only in the vertical plane containing the direction of propagation of the wave. The particle motion is retrograde elliptical at the surface grading into forward elliptical as the wave gets deeper. Rayleigh waves are usually the largest amplitude waves seen on a raw seismogram and are found typically found n the vertical and Radial records.
