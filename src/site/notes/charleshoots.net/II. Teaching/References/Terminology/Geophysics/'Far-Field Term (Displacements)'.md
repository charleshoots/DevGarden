Far-Field Term (Displacements)

Sunday, January 05, 2014

6:00 PM

far-field term (displacements): decays slowly, dominating displacement at large distances and disproportional to the time derivative of the reduced displacement potential, that is if there is a step in the effective pressure at the source there is an impulsive far-field ground motion.
