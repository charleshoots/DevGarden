Delamination

In [geophysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics), **delamination** refers to the loss and sinking of the portion of the lowermost [lithosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) from the [tectonic plate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plate) to which it was attached.

This can occur when the lower portion of the lithosphere becomes more dense than the surrounding [mantle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)). Because of the instability of higher [density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density) material atop lower density material, the lower lithosphere separates from the tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle.[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-1)

Delamination is of two basic types: brittle or ductile. In the brittle type, the lower crust metamorphoses to the denser [eclogite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogite), causing a density inversion,[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-Rollinson-2) which then may detach (rip away) and sink.

The second type, ductile delamination, is related to convective instabilities. The [convection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection) can simply peel away the lower crust. Or, in a different scenario, a [Rayleigh-Taylor instability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh-Taylor_instability) is created. Due to the instability in a local area, the base of the lithosphere breaks up into descending blobs fed by an enlarging region of thinning lithosphere. The space left by departing lithosphere is filled by an[asthenosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere) upwelling.[3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-3)

Delamination of the lithosphere has two major geologic effects. First, because a large portion of dense material is removed, the remaining portion of the crust and lithosphere undergo rapid [uplift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_uplift) to form mountain ranges. Second, flow of hot mantle material encounters the base of the thin lithosphere and often results in melting and a new phase of [volcanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism). Delamination may thus account for some volcanic regions that have been attributed to mantle plumes in the past.[4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-Foulger-4)

One example of the effects of lithosphere delamination is the [Sierra Nevada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)) mountains in the western USA.[5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-5)[6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination_(geology)#cite_note-delamination_lee-6)
