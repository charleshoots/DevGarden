P Wave

Sunday, January 05, 2014

6:00 PM

The primary or fastest wave traveling away from a seismic event through the rock and consisting of a train of compressions and dilatations of the material. P-waves can travel through the entire earth (including the liquid outer core). Their motion is analogous to sound waves. An elastic body wave or sound wave in which particles oscillate in the direction the wave propagates. P-waves incident on an interface at other than normal incidence can produce reflected and transmitted S-waves, in that case known as converted waves.
