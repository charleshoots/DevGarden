* With origin time and arrival time known, travel time can be easily calculated

* Origin Time - When the wave left the source

* Arrival Time - When the wave reached the receiver
* Travel Time - The time required for the wave to travel through the medium
* Amplitude and shape of the wave pulses that left the source are affected by propagation 
* Center of the Earth is approximately 6,371 Km.
* The existence and shape of the Earth's shallow crust, deeper mantle, liquid outer core, and solid inner core is inferred from variations in seismic velocity with depth.
* Waves bend at interfaces where the speed changes according to Snell's Law
	* Objects inserted into water appear crooked, that is because light travels more slowly in water than in air, so light bends at the interface.
	* Waves bend away from the vertical as they go deeper into the Earth as they cross into faster or slower mediums. Eventually, they 'bottom out' and go 'horizontal' where they turn upward and return to the surface. This occurs because, generally seismic waves velocities increase with depth and the Earth is a sphere so any deviation from the central axis to the core will ultimately bring the wave back to the surface.

An Interesting Observation BEFORE a large Earthquake, hmmm…

Nuclear Explosion Yield, Occurrence, and Location determined seismically

* World Wide Standardized Seismographic Network(WWSSN)
	* Established to monitor nuclear explosions
	* Plays a major role in modern geophysical [Seismology](../../II.%20Teaching/Seismology)
	* The conversion of seismic body waves into TNT yields from nuclear explosions was calibrated using the nevada test site.
	* The crust of the western US is more seismically attenuating than the more stable soviet sites in Kazakhstan and Novaya Zemlya.
	* Nevada ( C = 3.95 ) , Kazakhstan ( C = 4.45 )
* Distinguishing explosions from earthquakes
	* Earthquakes occur by slip across a fault, generating large amounts of shear wave energy and hence large surface waves.
		* In contrastl explosions involve motions away from the source, and so produce far less shear wave energy.
			* This means that for explosions, surface wave is dwarfed by the initial P wave signal. This is the basis for discrimination between earthquakes and explosions.
				* mb \= C + 0.75Log(Y)
					* Where Mb is the magnitude of the body waves through the Earth, Y is the yield of nuclear of the blast in Kilotons of TNT, and C is a constant for the local attenuation of seismic waves near the source.

Elastic Modulus

* Young's Modulus
	* Like any elastic moduli, Young's Modulus is the expression of an applied pressure ( p ) \[Force / Area\] divided by a fractional change in size (dL / L)
		* ![962x232](/img/user/Attachments/_LegacyAttachments/unknown_filename.2%2035.png)
* Poisson's Ratio
	* Poisson's Ratio is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain. This is the ratio of the amount of change in length in on direction divided by the amount of change in length along a perpendicular axis.
		* ![764x187](/img/user/Attachments/_LegacyAttachments/unknown_filename.3%2031.png)
* Shear Modulus
	* Shear Modulus is the ratio of shear stress divided by the strain caused by shearing
		* ![814x205](/img/user/Attachments/_LegacyAttachments/unknown_filename.8%2017.png)

* ![285x167](/img/user/Attachments/_LegacyAttachments/unknown_filename.1%2043.png)

* Nyquist Frequency - The sampling frequency required to ensure there is no errors in the sampled data. This is always twice the highest frequency in the observable signal.
