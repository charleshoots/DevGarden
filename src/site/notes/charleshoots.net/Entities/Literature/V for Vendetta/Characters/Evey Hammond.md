Evey Hammond is one of the central characters of [V for Vendetta](../../../../Reading/Have%20Read/V%20for%20Vendetta%20by%20Alan%20Moore.md).

Evey symbolizes the people— gullible, powerless, and the ones to be tormented by the government.

Moore used Evey as his medium to express certain key points of V for Vendetta, namely, how England came to be under fascist rule, and what it meant for common people—distress, torment, and docility.
