Delia Surridge is a researcher turned doctor and pathologist who did some hormone research on inmates of the [Larkhill](../Places/Larkhill.md).

What she did at Larkhill was undeniably evil. However, it was not a mediated one. She considered the inmates less than human which helped her to turn a blind eye to their sufferings. She is not a cruel one by nature and took [her punishment gracefully](V.md#Delia%20Surridge).
