**Bishop Anthony Lilliman** is one of the main villains of [V for Vendetta by Alan Moore](../../../../Reading/Have%20Read/V%20for%20Vendetta%20by%20Alan%20Moore.md). He worked at [Larkhill](../Places/Larkhill.md) as a religious motivator.

In contrast to other major characters of this work, he is simple in composition. So much so that you can consider an archetype for major religion's clergymen. Hypocrisy, collaboration with the [government](../Entities/The%20Government.md), perverse sexuality[^1] everything is present in his character.

[^1]: Pedophilia in this case.
