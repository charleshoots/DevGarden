Thanatology is the scientific study of death. To understand death, thanatologists approach from various point of view and use established subjects like biology, psychology, and sociology as standard tools.

Though the intention is purely scientific, I consider this subject a *soft science*. Except for biology, all the subjects composing Thanatology lack scientific rigour.
