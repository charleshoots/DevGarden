[Jibanananda Das](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibanananda_Das) is one of the greatest of all Bengali poets. Though [Tagore](Rabindranath%20Tagore.md) was doubtful of some of his works, ironically, Jibananada's modernity owes most to Tagore himself. In fact, Jibanananda's modern works (all after his first poetry book) got many inspirations from [Tagore's experiments](Rabindranath%20Tagore.md#Tagore%20and%20Modernity).

Jibanananda's strong suite though is an acute [mono no aware](../Concept/Aesthetics/Mono%20no%20aware.md), wielded masterfully like none before him. It is so strong that even when expressing human expressions, this pathos of things will be the dominant feeling.

Through and through, Jibananada is a modern man with modern crisis. So much so that his writings has uncanny similarities with coeval western writer [Fernando Pessoa](Fernando%20Pessoa.md)'s [Book of Disquiet](../../Reading/Have%20Read/The%20Book%20of%20Disquiet_%20The%20Complete%20Edition%20by%20Fernando%20Pessoa.md), written over the same time yet published much later. Surely, Jibanananda couldn't have read those.
