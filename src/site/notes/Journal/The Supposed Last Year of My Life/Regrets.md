The raaga is named **Darbari Kanada**. A raaga that is sombre, depressingly beautiful, a raaga of midnight. The name suggests that it is a raaga of *darbar*, a court of some king or emperor of the East.[^1]

That emperor must have such a refined taste! Instead of some activities of base pleasures (which is rather common amongst the powerful people), the emperor preferred a sombre raaga.

Sometimes earlier, I expressed [regrets for not being born in the feudal Japan](../..Reading/Have%20Read/Narrow%20Road%20to%20the%20Interior_%20And%20Other%20Writings%20by%20Matsuo%20Bashō.md#^aa2b0c). This is another regret of mine— of not being in such a court of refined taste.

[^1]: As the legend goes, the emperor was Akbar, and Miyan Tansen bought the Raaga from Carnatic music.
