বইটা চমৎকার। রুদ্রর কবিতার মত, "আমি কি চেয়েছি কুমির তাড়ায়ে বাঘের কবলে যেতে?" মেবি ওরওয়েল সত্যিকার অর্থে চিরায়ত সাহিত্যের জন্ম দিয়েছেন। চিরায়ত ভালোবাসাও, যা নিয়ে লেখার কমতি নেই। তেমন চিরায়ত এই মানবিক অন্ধকারগুলোও। [১৯৮৪](1984%20by%20George%20Orwell) এবং অ্যানিমাল ফার্ম সেই অন্ধকারের উপাখ্যান।  
  
স্পয়লার লিখতে ইচ্ছে নেই তবুও একটু ক্যোট না করে পারছি না:

* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.

The ensuing rebellion under the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm. Vowing to eliminate the terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organized to benefit all who walk on four legs. But as time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. And something new and unexpected emerges… Animal Farm—the history of a rebellion that went wrong—is George Orwell’s brilliant satire on the corrupting influence of power. ‘Remains our great satire of the darker face of modern history’ – Malcolm Bradbury. All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others.
