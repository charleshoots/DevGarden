The ensuing rebellion under the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm. Vowing to eliminate the terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organized to benefit all who walk on four legs. But as time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. And something new and unexpected emerges… Animal Farm—the history of a rebellion that went wrong—is George Orwell’s brilliant satire on the corrupting influence of power. ‘Remains our great satire of the darker face of modern history’ – Malcolm Bradbury. All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others.
