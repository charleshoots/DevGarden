Until you finish it, you'll never notice how well-crafted this novel is. That is how good art or literature should be. It will hide the craftsmanship. The narrative was concise, flowing, and captivating.  
  
Another thing not strictly about this book is, that I envy authors who (though being a man) can portray women in such a way that it compels you to think that they know women from the depth of their psychology. I know they don't know everything about women. However, they can create a character that may not be like 'This is how women are' but will be like 'This is also how a woman can be'. Dazai can do this very well.
