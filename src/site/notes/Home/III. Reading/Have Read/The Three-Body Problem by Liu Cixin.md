> [!HINT] Impressions
> Precision, philosophical, expansive, intricate, not-so-pop science.

The first thing I noticed about this book is the scientific precision, to be specific. The images are only the vehicle of bigger ideas and are minimal in composition. The prose is seldom descriptive of the environment. Tantalising technologies almost play no role in this work. Instead, their implications have been discussed heavily.

Like any sophisticated science-fiction, this one makes philosophy *story-able*. And that storyscape unfurled over a large expanse of space and time.

# Note

#Personal
* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.
