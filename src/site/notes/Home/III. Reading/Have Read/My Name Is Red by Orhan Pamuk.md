* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.

Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk's [My Name Is Red](../Notes%20and%20Highlights/My%20Name%20Is%20Red), set amid the artistic splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, is a fantastical story of love and murder propelled by the philosophical puzzle at its core. The Ottoman sultan has commissioned the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm—but he wants them to illuminate it in the European style. Because there are those who believe art that imitates the real is an affront to Islam, the project must be kept secret. Panic and scandal erupt when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears, along with a crucial page of the manuscript. the surviving artists—bitter rivals variously motivated by pride, greed, faith, and love—are all under suspicion of murder, and the only clue to the mystery lies in the half-finished illustrations themselves.
