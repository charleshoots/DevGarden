but this would be self-indulgent and foolish. We must surrender our skepticism only in the face of rock-solid evidence. Science demands a tolerance for ambiguity. Where we are ignorant, we withhold belief. Whatever annoyance the uncertainty engenders serves a higher purpose: It drives us to accumulate better data. This attitude is the difference between science and so much else. Science offers little in the way of cheap thrills. The standards of evidence are strict. But when followed they allow us to see far, illuminating even a great darkness.

# Note

#Personal
* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.
