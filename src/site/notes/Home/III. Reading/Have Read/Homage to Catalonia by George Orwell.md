		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones

	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress

	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
