# Definition
The conservation of momentum is a special case when the net [impulse](Impulse) is zero. This implies that no [external forces](Newton%20Laws) are acting on a body or a system. From the [impulse momentum theorem](Impulse-Momentum%20Theorem), because the net impulse is zero, the [change in momentum](Linear%20Momentum) is zero as well.

$$
\text{If $I=0$} \Rightarrow \Delta p =0
