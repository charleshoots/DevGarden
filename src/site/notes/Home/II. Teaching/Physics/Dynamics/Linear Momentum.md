# General Principle
Linear momentum is a conserved quantity and describes how much force affects motion. It's an [[Intrinsic & Extrinsic Properties\|intrinsic]] property. Mathematically, linear momentum is defined as the mass times [velocity](../Kinematics/Velocity) at a point in time.

$$
\vec{p} =m\vec{v}
$$

>[!info] Important 
High momentum - Harder to stop
Low momentum - easier to stop
