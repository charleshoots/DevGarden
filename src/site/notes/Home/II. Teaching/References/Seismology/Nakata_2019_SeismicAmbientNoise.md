# ::p16:: Often referred to as “noise,” these weak permanent vibrations are the physical signals that are produced by seismic waves, although their sources are often poorly understood, and they change their nature and location with the frequency band considered. This natural noise is particularly strong in the microseism band (0.04–0.2 Hz), which is also of interest for imaging purposes at the lithospheric and global scales.

# ::p16:: The relationships between meteorological activity, oceanic swell and microseisms were noted in the earliest days of the study of seismograms.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=16&annotation=KIS474DM)
# ::p16:: Back in 1980, in his presidential address to the Seismological Society of America, Aki2 proposed to use the microseisms generated under the oceans: We know now it is possible to simultaneously determine the locations and origin times of local earthquakes and the structure of the earth in which the earthquakes are taking place, if we have a sufficient number of stations. In principle, this method of simultaneously determining the source and structure parameters can be extended to the microseisms, because the source of microseisms can probably be described by a finite number of parameters.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=16&annotation=3VC4BB8V)
# ::p17:: Interestingly, he also indicated: The advantage of microseisms is that they exist 24 hours a day, all year around. A signal processing method may be developed to extract the body wave part of microseisms, in order to use them for deep structure studies.

# ::p17:: This was an important conceptual advance.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=17&annotation=MRSG96I8)
# ::p17:: Assuming a single surface wave mode, Aki used a specific local array geometry to remove the effect of directivity of the noise by azimuthal averaging.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=17&annotation=KT6ESBK6)
# ::p17:: The modern version relies on the spatio-temporal variability of the noise source, or on scattering, to produce the required averaging.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=17&annotation=JMAR7VA9)
# ::p17:: Note that under restrictive conditions on the nature of the noise, firm theoretical ground exists to support this approach without inter-station distance limitations or hypotheses as to the structure of the medium.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=17&annotation=RAWHIZA5)
# ::p17:: Although these conditions on the noise properties are rarely fully satisfied, the magic of waves is operating in the form of time reversibility and spatial reciprocity that leads to partial reconstruction of the impulse responses between two points from the correlations of

# ::p18:: passive records.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=ICY9AB8N)
# ::p18:: Noise correlations can be understood as a realization of an experiment of time-reversal self-focusing
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=Q7E8I7K3)
# ::p18:: With a large array of N three-component station arrays, a set of N · (N − 1)/2 inter-station paths can be built for each nine cross-component correlation to be computed for positive and negative time
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=L8N9VIBF)
# ::p18:: This approach has been applied worldwide at scales ranging from shallow layers for engineering purposes to lithospheric imaging.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=IC3C56G8)
# ::p18:: Long-period body waves are weakly sensitive to scattering, and specific analyses have to be done before apparent travel times can be used in correlations for inferring Earth structures. This is a typical example where detailed knowledge of the structure of the wavefield is required.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=B82ULKD2)
# ::p18:: Together with refined models of microseism sources constructed from seismological analysis and from independent meteorological and oceanographic observations, the initial strategy of Aki in the 1980s to invert for sources and structures can be reconsidered with up-to-date inversion procedures.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=18&annotation=6TF85DEB)
# ::p19:: For the study of deep processes, the difficulty is that the Earth’s crust is also changing through various external forces (e.g., rainfall, snow load, tidal and thermal effects), and that these effects have to be removed from the actual temporal observations to isolate the changes related to internal processes of natural or industrial origins.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=19&annotation=LJK2R3LP)
# ::p19:: Ambient noise seismology is a promising field that is in rapid evolution, and that has turned out to be one of the main components of geophysical imaging.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=19&annotation=UXKEZ8WE)
# ::p19:: As solutions are proposed, new questions appear, more and more scientists are involved, and novel data analyses lead to discoveries; there can be no doubt that the years to come will be fascinating. Ambient noise still holds a lot of the mysteries of the Earth to reveal.

# ::p21:: In the late 1860s and early 1870s, the Italian priest Timoteo Bertelli (1826–1905) mounted a pendulum on the wall of the college where he taught natural sciences. With the help of a lens, he observed the phenomenon that he had traced in historic records back to the year 1643: small, spontaneous movements that did not have any obvious explanation. Following improvements of his instrument and thousands of experiments, he was able to exclude passing vehicles, wind, and temperature variations as possible sources (Davison, 1927). In 1872 he concluded that some of his microseismic observations coincided with distant earthquakes but also with barometric depressions (Bertelli, 1872). Furthermore, they seemed to be stronger in winter than in summer. He had made some of the first reliable observations of the ambient seismic field, providing a first indication of its possible sources.

# ::p21:: The ambient field generated by these forces constitutes the seismic background radiation of the Earth, historically referred to as microseisms
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=21&annotation=W5S93M26)
# ::p21:: The quasi-random nature of the ambient field, a small snapshot of which is shown in Figure I.1, disables the detection of distinct arrivals, well-known from the analysis of earthquakes, explosions, or other sources of short duration that

# ::p22:: have traditionally been the subject of seismological investigations.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=22&annotation=T3USZZ83)
# ::p22:: The absence of an easily identifiable, deterministic signal has led to the common classification of the ambient field as seismic ambient noise.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=22&annotation=3JR9NYKW)
# ::p22:: Indeed, when averaging over long enough times, the interstation correlation C(xA, xB, t) = ∫ u(xA,τ)u(xB, t + τ)dτ, (i) approximates the wavefield that would be recorded at receiver position xB if a source had acted at receiver position xA.

# ::p25:: Chapter 1 by McNamara and Boaz (2018) describes the spectral properties of the ambient field, from the high frequencies that result from human activity, to low frequencies caused largely by ocean waves. The chapter introduces the powerspectral density as one of the most useful tools to characterize the noise level experienced by a seismic network. Knowing the noise power-spectral density is crucial for applications like earthquake monitoring and detection where small but interesting events may easily drown within the noise.

# ::p26:: the actual physics of ambient noise generation, covered in Chapter 3 by Ardhuin et al. (2018)
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=26&annotation=AW7YB3MG)
# ::p26:: At frequencies below 1 Hz, where anthropogenic noise excitation is weak, ocean waves are the dominant source.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=26&annotation=JYNU4FXC)
# ::p26:: Though seismic waves have wavelengths much longer than ocean waves, for a given frequency, two mechanisms are shown to provide efficient coupling to the solid Earth: the direct interference of ocean waves with shallow ocean bottom topography, and the interference of pairs of ocean waves that exert small pressure variations also at greater depths.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=26&annotation=Z568IYT7)
# ::p26:: To the frustration of ambitious ambient field seismologists, the precious noise tends to be superimposed by transient signals with much higher amplitude, for instance, from earthquakes. The challenge of emphasizing noise so as to promote the emergence of correlation functions that reliably approximate a Green’s function is the subject of Chapter 5 by Ritzwoller and Feng (2018).

# ::p26:: Quasi-random wavefields may arise from quasi-random sources, such as ocean waves, but also from multiple scattering in the heterogeneous Earth. In this regard, scattering-generated coda waves and the ambient field are close relatives.
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=26&annotation=LWJNVDP9)
# ::p26:: As shown by Snieder et al. (2018) in Chapter 6, subtle changes of coda waves are valuable indicators of changes in Earth structure
[LINK](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LCGL7GHQ?page=26&annotation=XZV73BMZ)
# ::p26:: Despite being diffuse in nature, coda waves may in fact be used to locate temporal velocity variations.
