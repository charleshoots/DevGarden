delta function: a mathematical generalized function that can be regarded as the limit of any several sequences of continuous function. It also has the sifting  property where the delta function picks out the value of a function at t0 if it is multiplied by the function and integrated over all time. A final definition is the derivative of of a step function since it is zero except near t0 when it goes to infinity. Also known as a impulse.
