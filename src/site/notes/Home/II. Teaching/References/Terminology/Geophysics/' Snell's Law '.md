Snell's Law

Sunday, January 05, 2014

a geometric property of rays that describes how a ray will travel from one medium into another depending on the angle of incidence and the medium velocity. It can help predict at which angle the ray will be deflected in the new medium (velocity) and where the ray will land within that layer.
