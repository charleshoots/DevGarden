**Def:** A topological space is called *metacompact* if every open cover of $X$ has a point-finite open refinement.

**Def:** A cover $\{A_\alpha\mid \alpha <\kappa\}$ of a space $X$ will be called *irreducible* if $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha \neq X$ for every $I \subset \kappa$. 

**Prop:** Every point-finite cover $\{A_\alpha\mid \alpha<\kappa\}$ of a space $X$ has an irreducible subcover.

**Obs:** Every paracompact space is metacompact.

**Th:** Every countably compact metacompact space is compact. 

**Michael-Nagami Theorem:** Every metacompact collectionwise $T_4$ space is paracompact.

**Lemma:** For every open cover $\{U_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ of a metacompact space there is a point finite cover $\{V_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ of $X$ such that $V_\alpha \subseteq U_\alpha$ for every $\alpha <\kappa$. 

**Lemma:** If there is a closed, continuous and surjective function $f:X \to Y$, and $X$ is a metacompact space, then every open $\sigma$-point finite cover of $Y$ have a point finite open refinement. 

**Worrell's Theorem:** Let $X$ and $Y$ be $T_2$ spaces. If $f:X \to Y$ be a closed, continuous and surjective function, and $X$ is metacompact, then $Y$ is metacompact.

**Th:** Let $Y$ be a metacompact space. If $f: X\to Y$ is a perfect function, then $X$ is also metacompact.

**Prop:** If $X$ is $T_2$ metacompact and $Y$ is $T_2$ and compact, then $X\times Y$ is metacompact.
