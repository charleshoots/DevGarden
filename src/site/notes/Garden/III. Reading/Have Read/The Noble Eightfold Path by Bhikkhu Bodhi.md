* Hypoglycemia
	* Frequent episodes of hypoglycemia can result in "hypoglycemia unawareness"
		* A metabolic condition that impairs the body's production of counter regulatory hormones
	* The body's natural stress response is impaired by hypoglycemia.
	* The stress and metabolic related effects can be reversed completely in up to 3 weeks as long as in those 3 weeks you avoid hypos
* Hyperglycemia
	* Can impair the body's ability to synthesize protein into muscle tissue
	* Complicate the body's electrolyte metabolism.
	* Abnormally high amounts of inflammatory oxidative stress
* GLUT4
	* This hormone is the only pathway glucose has to refuel muscle tissue
	* It does NOT require insulin
	* The more muscle mass an individual has the more glucose capacity their body has, allowing a natural barrier to hyperglycemia.

One is the Four Noble Truths, in which the Buddha diagnoses the problem of suffering and indicates the treatment necessary to remedy this problem. The other is the Noble Eightfold Path, the practical discipline he prescribes to uproot and eliminate the deep underlying causes of suffering. The present book offers, in simple and clear language, a concise yet thorough explanation of the Eightfold Path. Basing himself solidly upon the Buddha's own words, the author examines each factor of the path to determine exactly what it implies in the way of practical training. Finally, in the concluding chapter, he shows how all eight factors of the path function in unison to bring about the realization of the Buddhist goal: enlightenment and liberation.
