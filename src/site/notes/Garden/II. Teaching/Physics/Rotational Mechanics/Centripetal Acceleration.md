# Definition 
Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration towards the centre of a circle that keeps an object rotating around a circle at constant [angular speed](Angular%20Speed).

## Derivation 
> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive centripetal acceleration, assume the following:
> - [Acceleration](../Kinematics/Acceleration) is the [[Rate of Change\|change]] in [velocity](../Kinematics/Velocity) over the change in time
> - [Angular velocity](Angular%20Velocity) is described as $\omega = \frac{v}{r} \Rightarrow v=\omega r$
> - The [[Arc Length of Circles\|arc length]] of a circle is $s = r\theta$
> - Use the image below as a visual aid for the derivation
![[ca.png\|300]]
> - $\triangle ABC, \triangle PQR$ are [[Similar Triangles\|similar triangles]]
> - Angle in $\triangle PQR$ is the same angle in $\triangle ABC$
> 
**Note this derivation does not use the calculus approach** 

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{The arc length $\vec{v_{1}}$ and $\vec{v_{2}}$ is denoted as $v\Delta t$ or $\Delta s = v\Delta t$}\\ \\
\text{If $\Delta t$ between the two points are very small then}\\
\text{for $\triangle ABC$ $\Delta r= \Delta s$ because the time between two points are so small}\\
\\
\text{Because $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$ are similar the ratio between the two are:} 
\\
\frac{\Delta v}{v}= \frac{v\Delta t}{r} \\

\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v^2}{r} \\
\vec{a} = \frac{v^2}{r} \\ \\
\text{Described in terms of angular velocity:}
\\ 
\vec{a}_{c} = \omega^2 r



\end{array}
