**Def:** A topological space $X$ is *collectionwise $T_2$* or *collectionwise Hausdorff* if given any closed discrete subset of $X$ $\{x_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ there's a celular family $\{U_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ such that $x_\alpha \in U_\alpha$ for every $\alpha < \kappa$.

**Def:** A topological space $X$ is *strongly collectionwise $T_2$* or *strongly collectionwise Hausdorff* if given any closed discrete subset of $X$ $\{x_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ there's a discrete open family $\{U_\alpha \mid \alpha < \kappa\}$ such that $x_\alpha \in U_\alpha$ for every $\alpha < \kappa$.

**Obs:** Every collectionwise normal space is strongly collectionwise Hausdorff, and every strongly collectionwise Hausdorff is collectionwise Hausdorff.

**Obs:** Every collectionwise $T_2$ space is $T_2$.
