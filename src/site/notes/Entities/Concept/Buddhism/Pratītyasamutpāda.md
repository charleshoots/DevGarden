Pratītyasamutpāda (dependant origination) is a Buddhist doctrine that claims that all phenomena arises from another and makes way for other phenomena to happen.

## Significance
Most other concepts like [Anattā](Anatman.md), [impermanence](Anitya.md), [karma](Reading/Notes%20and%20Highlights/The%20Fundamental%20Wisdom%20of%20the%20Middle%20Way.md#Time：2020-11-21%2015:28) etc can be derived from this as shown by Nāgārjuna in his [Mūlamadhyamakakārikā](../../../Reading/Have%20Read/The%20Fundamental%20Wisdom%20of%20the%20Middle%20Way.md).
