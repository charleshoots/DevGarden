Adam James Susan is the leader of the **Norsefire** and the leader of the [government](../Entities/The%20Government.md).

Although evil, the leader is a sincere person. He simply puts *all* before the *individual* (including himself). If we consider the romantic attraction he feels for [Fate](../Entities/Fate.md) perverse, then he is also a neurotic.
