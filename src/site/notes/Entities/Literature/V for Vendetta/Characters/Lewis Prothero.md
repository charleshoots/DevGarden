Prothero is a richly compound character.

## Characteristics
### Ex-Commander
Firstly, he is an ex-commander of the army and was a director of [Larkhill](../Places/Larkhill.md). There we can find him particularly cruel.

### A Collector of Dolls
Contrasting to his cruelty, we can find a completely different man if we consider his obsession with collecting dolls. This came to be his undoing when [V](V.md) used this for [his psychological attack](V.md#Lewis%20Prothero).

### Voice of Fate
Prothero has a powerful, and charismatic voice which is known to the population as the voice of [Fate](../Entities/Fate.md) itself. This is particularly useful to the [government](../Entities/The%20Government.md) since they can exploit it to connect to the population in a more humane way.
