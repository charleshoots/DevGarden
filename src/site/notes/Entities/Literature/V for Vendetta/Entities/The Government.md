The government is quite similar to many dystopian oligarchies. It is definitely fascist. Contraptions of mass surveillance, and mass media is very much active.

The government considers itself a *body* headed by a [supreme leader](../Characters/Adam%20James%20Susan.md) and consisting of various body parts like *fingers* (police), *ears, eyes, nose* (surveillance), and *voice* (propaganda). 

Another defining factor of the government is the [Fate](Fate.md). The AI that helps to run the show.
